Feature: Search on index


    Background:
        Given there is no index named "my_index"
        And I create an index named "my_index" with the configuration from "data/config.yml"
        When I add objects of type "my_type" to index "my_index" with data :
            | id | first_name | nick_name    | age | gender | description                                                     |
